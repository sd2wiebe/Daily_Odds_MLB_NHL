# Saving Daily MLB and NHL odds

## Having some fun with BeautifulSoup and python

This program will extract and store daily NHL hockey and MLB baseball matchups and corresponding betting odds. 
 
The betting odds we are scraping are in decimal form and represent the moneyline for each team. We are using a reputable sports book for our odds in pinnacle.com.

The data is then put into a nice little dataframe and subsequently saved as an excel file which denotes the sport and date in the title.
